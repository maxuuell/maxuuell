## Staying In
Like many who are still employed, I am working from home. This is great for me, because I always wanted to work from home.

## Gaming
Really excited that Google Stadia is ramping up, slowly, with bigger releases and promised features. The prospect of never having to buy a console again, or wait for downloads, and to be able to play ubiquitously on several devices, is _very_ appealing.

## Reading
Just starting _The Wheel of Time_ series with [The Eye of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eye_of_the_World).
