## House Renovations
After moving out of the bay area to work remotely full-time, my wife and I have started a ton of house renovations. Not sure if we took on too much at once, but so far so good.

So far, we've tackled painting, some modest tiling, and laying sod in the backyard. Working on the master bathroom next.

## Gaming
Really excited that Google Stadia is ramping up, slowly, with bigger releases and promised features. The prospect of never having to buy a console again, wait for downloads, and to be able to play ubiquitously on several devices, is _very_ appealing.

Specifically, I am bouncing around between the Final Fantasy 7 Switch port, Final Fantasy XV on Stadia, and watching my wife play The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. 

## Reading
Just finished [The Eye of the World](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Eye_of_the_World), the first book in the _The Wheel of Time_ series.

## 30x500
To reach my larger goals of finding more freedom with regards to time and finances, I've started Amy Hoy and Alex Hillman's [30x500 Academy](https://30x500.com/academy/).

I've gone through the first 30%, and am really enjoying it. It's a lot of to put into practice their research driven approach to selling products, but I think it will be worth it.
