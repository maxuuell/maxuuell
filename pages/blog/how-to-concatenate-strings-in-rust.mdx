If you are new to Rust, you many have to re-learn how to do certain tasks that you almost did automatically in other languages.

When I was working on [swcli](https://github.com/maxuuell/swcli), I needed to create a URL dynamically, based on user input. I ended up finding 5 approaches to create the URL. Now, I am going to share those 5 approaches, and share which ones may be the best, going forward.

## Good ol' + Operator

```
let url = String::from("http://swapi.dev/api/") + &args.attributes + "/" + &args.id;
```

I just tried this as a carry over from the pre-[template literal](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals) days. This is one of the ways you could concatenate strings in Javascript.

## Format Macro

```
let url = format!("http://swapi.dev/api/{}/{}", args.attributes, args.id);
```

Straight from the [rust docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.format.html):

> A common use forÂ format!Â is concatenation and interpolation of strings.

## Use `push_str` on a `String` struct

```
let mut url = String::from("http://swapi.dev/api/");
url.push_str(&args.attributes);
url.push_str("/");
url.push_str(&args.id);
```

This pattern is great, but does require a mutable reference. Everything in Rust is immutable by default. If you don't want a mutable reference to your string, consider one of the other options.

## Array.concat()

```
let url = ["http://swapi.dev/api/", &args.attributes, "/", &args.id].concat();
```
    
This pattern leverages an array to concatenate the items together. This was recommended by [scottmcm](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/any-difference-between-these-concatenation-strategies/47094/5?u=maxuuell) as the cleanest and fully efficient way of concatenating strings.

## The Actual `url` Crate
```
let paths = [&args.attributes, "/", &args.id].concat();
let url = Url::parse("http://swapi.dev/api/")?;
let url = url.join(&paths)?;
```

If you recall, I needed to create a URL dynamically. What I should have started with, and what you should too if you need to create a URL, is just use the [url crate](https://docs.rs/url/2.1.1/url/). 

The `.join()` method only allows you to append one string to the end of the url and path. In this case, I had to use the `.concat()` approach mentioned above to concatenate my cli arguments to then join them to the base url.

If you need to concatenate strings for a more general purpose, follow the `.concat()` recommendations above. 

Happy coding! ðŸ¤“
