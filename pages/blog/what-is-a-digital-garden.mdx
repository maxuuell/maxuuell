title: What is a Digital Garden
date: July 17, 2020

A digital garden where you post ideas and thoughts that are raw, in contrast to a traditional blog post that may be refined, long, and well supported.

Digital garden posts (seedlings) are for you to plant, cultivate, and explore. They encourage discussion, and aren't meant to be scrutinized like you might do with a traditional blog post. 

Seedlings are not marketing focused.

For me, the digital garden concept is very liberating. I've often felt overwhelmed by writing traditional blogs, because of the weight of it having to _be_ something. 

With a digital garden, I feel encouraged to write without fear or anxiety around how my raw ideas will be perceived.
