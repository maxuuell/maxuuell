I think Roam fits perfectly into a digital garden workflow.

Would be dope to export Roam blocks into mdx files, with front matter, and have them published here.

Ideally, with the help of some chrome extension, or [access to their APIs](https://roamresearch.com/), there could be a complete pipeline where my Roam db is the source, and updates are just fetched and deployed.
